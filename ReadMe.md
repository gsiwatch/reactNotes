#### React
* Don't touch the DOM I will do it
* Building website like lego boxes -- reusable components
* React development tool -- allows us to see the components that we build into an application.
* Unidirectional data flow -- anything that changes updates the state and as soon as the state changes this information passed on to the components and then components changes the behavior (if it has to)
* Components are build using JSX (javascript xml), all this going to create virtual DOM
