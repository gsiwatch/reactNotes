#### React
* Don't touch the DOM I will do it
* Building website like lego boxes -- reusable components
* React development tool -- allows us to see the components that we build into an application.
* Unidirectional data flow -- anything that changes updates the state and as soon as the state changes this information passed on to the components and then components changes the behavior (if it has to)
* Components are build using JSX (javascript xml), all this going to create virtual DOM
* Some of the key words:
    * Declarative
    * JSX
    * Components
    * State
    * Props
    * VirtualDOM
###### Installing React
* install node 
* npx create-react-app <app_name>
* you can also prefer to install nvm for node version management if on the machine a person need different node versions
